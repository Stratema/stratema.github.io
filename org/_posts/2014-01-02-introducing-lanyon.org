Lanyon is an unassuming [[http://jekyllrb.com][Jekyll]] theme that
places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's
based on [[http://getpoole.com][Poole]], the Jekyll butler.

*** Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective
foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole,
and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

-  Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [[/404][404]],
   [[/atom.xml][RSS feed]], posts, and [[/about][example page]])
-  Mobile friendly design and development
-  Easily scalable text and component sizing with =rem= units in the CSS
-  Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
-  Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
-  Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet
   highlighter)

*** Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

-  Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via *â˜°* link in top
   corner
-  Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically
   generated navigation with active link support
-  Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and
   [[https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout][reverse]] (right
   sidebar), available via =<body>= classes
-  [[https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes][Eight optional color
   schemes]], available via =<body>= classes

more.

*** Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the
latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it
is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

*** Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the GitHub
repository for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
